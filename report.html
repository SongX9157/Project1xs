                <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 60px; padding-top: 20px;">my report</h1>
                <p style="padding:2% 5% 5% 5%; font-size: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, my client is the game club held by Chinese students, so I made this web site for the club. The website title is Game Club. It has five pages in total including overview, introduction and three separated game pages. I set the toolbar on the top right of the page and through the toolbar the user can jump to the other pages. Every page can accommodate to the large screen of pc and small screen of mobile devices. When the website opened in mobile device, the toolbar and the arrangement of divs will change. Every page has a same style by using the global style called xsstyle.css, which make the page in the color of dark blue and grey and some div settings. This website also contains multiple fonts and many pictures of games. The pictures are all screenshots made by myself and my friends and they all have the alt attributes. I also cite some pictures containing reviews from the game official site including From Software and Bandai. I didnâ€™t use any libraries or frameworks. This site all made by the original CSS and JS. My CSS and HTML file are validated without any warning and error by using the validator. Files are all named by numbers and low case characters. The site serves by the port 8443 and can only be access through https. There is a contact form written in the introduction page, it allows users to write down something and submit it. Furthermore, in the top part of the index page, every game pictures in the scroll part have a link to the official game site. There is also a scroll part in the sekiro page. The scroll part can automaticly change the picture slides and have two pointers, by clicking these pointers we can change the slide into previous one and next one. Also, the two picture scrolls are made by the different type of js.<br><br>Song Xu</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 60px;">client report</h1>
                <p style="padding:2% 5% 5% 5%; font-size: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, this site makes sense to me because I am a gamer and I am familiar with all those video games introduced in the web site. It reminds me of the unique experiences that these games brought to me at this time. The introduction to these games is pretty precise and general, especially to people who have not played them. It will be a good guide for good games for the masses. I hope it could include more games. The design of the pages is straightforward and brief. They tidily show the features and USP virtually. The main color of the pages, which are dark blue and grey, is very classic since it is similar to Steam.</p>
